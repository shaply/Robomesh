MAKE IT a intruder and greeter thing that uses the infared, speaker, and maybe the ultrasonic sensor to greet me or say intruder alert by sending detected person messages to the server and at certain times, the server will change how the speaker should respond.


This robot will just have an ultrasonic sensor that sends a message to the server when it senses something close to it.

This is mainly to test if the structure I've created makes making a robot relatively easy as well as test the flow of the TCP and HTTP servers.
